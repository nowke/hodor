; THe internal procedures in the scheme-number package are essentially nothing more 
; than calls to the primitive procedures +, -, etc. It was not possible to use the 
; primitives of the language directly because our `type-tag` system requires that
; each data object have a type attached to it. In fact, however, all Lisp
; implementations do have a type system, which they use internally. Primitive 
; predicates such as `symbol?` and `number?` determine whether data objects have 
; particular types. Modify the definitions of `type-tag`, `contents`, and `attach-tag` 
; from Section 2.4.2 so that our generic system takes advantage of Schemeâ€™s 
; internal type system. That is to say, the system should work as before except that
; ordinary numbers should be represented simply as Scheme numbers rather than as 
; pairs whose car is the symbol `scheme-number`
