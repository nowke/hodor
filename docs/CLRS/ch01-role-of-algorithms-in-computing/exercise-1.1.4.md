How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar? How are they different?

**Shortest path** (SP) and **Travelling salesman problems** (TSP) are modelled using graphs and involve minimizing the distance. TSP involves minimizing path which must include a set of vertices, whereas SP involves minimizing path between only two vertices (start and end)
