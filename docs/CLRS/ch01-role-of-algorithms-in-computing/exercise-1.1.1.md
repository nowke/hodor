Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that requires computing a convex hull.

**Sorting**

* Retrieve blog posts from database sorted by date
* Show list of files present in a folder sorted by name
* World population statistics report - sorted by count per country

**Convex hull**

* Collision detection
* Detecting human faces - [Algorithm for detecting human faces based on convex-hull](https://www.osapublishing.org/DirectPDFAccess/22CFF016-D4DF-75FC-2B85D4109D44F0DE_68360/oe-10-6-274.pdf)
* Geographic Information System (GIS) - [Calculate the minimum bounding geometry for the selected points.
