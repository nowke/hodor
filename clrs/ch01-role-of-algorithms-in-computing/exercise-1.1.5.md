Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good enough.

Authentication based on fingerprint should have the best solution implemented. A false authentication cannot be tolerated. Whereas, finding shortest path between two points can return a solution which is approximately short.
