Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths and limitations.

**Stack**

***Strengths***

* Fast access of top element (constant time)
* Push and pop operations are constant time
* Best suited for recursive algorithms

***Limitations***

* Fixed size - causes overflow if more than allocated elements are inserted
* Only one element can be accessed at a time (i.e. top element)
