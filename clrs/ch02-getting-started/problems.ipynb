    "> Although merge sort runs in $\\Theta(n\\cdot log_2n)$ worst-case time and insertion sort runs in $\\Theta(n^2)$ worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to ***coarsen*** the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in which *n / k* sublists of length *k* are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where *k* is a value to be determined.\n",

    "In merge sort, we know that height of tree (by halving at each step, problem of size n into subproblems of size 1) is $log_2n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we decided to stop when the subproblem becomes sufficiently small - i.e. at *k*. Hence height of the tree is $log_2n - log_2k = log_2(n/k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step, we are merging a total of *n* elements ($n/k \\cdot k$). Hence merging takes a total of $\\Theta(n)$ time.\n",
