    "> Although merge sort runs in $\\Theta(n\\cdot log_2n)$ worst-case time and insertion sort runs in $\\Theta(n^2)$ worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to ***coarsen*** the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in which *n / k* sublists of length *k* are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard merging mechanism, where *k* is a value to be determined.\n",
