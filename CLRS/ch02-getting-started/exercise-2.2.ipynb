Then find the second smallest element of *A*, and exchange it with *A[2]*. Continue in this manner for the first *n - 1* elements of *A*. Write pseudocode for this algorithm, which is known as ***selection sort***. What loop invariant does this algorithm maintain? Why does it need to run for only the first *n - 1* elements, rather than for all *n* elements? Give the best-case and worst-case running times of selection sort in $\\Theta$-notation.\n",
