; Define the below operation for painters. below takes two painters as arguments. The resulting painter, given
; a frame, draws with the first painter in the bottom of the frame and with the second painter in the top.
; Define below in two different ways â€” first by writing a procedure that is analogous to the beside procedure
; given above, and again in terms of beside and suitable rotation operations (from Exercise 2.50).
